# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# log and temp files
/log/*.log
.byebug_history
/tmp

# annoying files
.DS_Store

# bundler
/.bundle
/vendor

# dev environment
*.sublime-workspace

# bower components - usually necessary to manually check in some parts of each
# bower component, remember to do this on a case-by-case basis
/app/assets/bower_components

# dotenv
/.env
